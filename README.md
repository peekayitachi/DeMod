# DeMod

# Problem Statement <br /> 
Bias and corruption among moderators lead to power imbalances and a "MOD IS GOD" scenario in an otherwise democratic setting. Centralized moderation is susceptible to bias, whether unintentional or systematic, leading to uneven enforcement of guidelines.
                   

# Solution <br /> 
Mitigating cost to company on content moderation while ALSO shifting the moderation rights to the users of the platform. This will be done with the help of a decentralized system based on blockchain which will work as an extension to already existing social media apps.

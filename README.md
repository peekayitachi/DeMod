# DeMod : A Decentralized Content Moderation Solution<br />

# Description
## Why this project was made
As the User-Generated Content (UGC) has been growing in the past few years, there has been a need of a proper moderation system as well. Content giants like Meta, X(twitter), Youtube, Quora have setup huge in-house moderation teams for this purpose, but there have been further developments. Bias and corruption among content moderators lead to power imbalances and a "MOD IS GOD" scenario in an otherwise democratic setting. Centralized moderation is susceptible to bias, whether unintentional or systematic, leading to uneven enforcement of guidelines. <br /> 
This project is supposed to help fight this problem by handing the powers of moderation to the everyday user where they get to vote on what should stay on the platform and which one should be removed
                   
## Solution <br /> 
Mitigating cost to company on content moderation while ALSO shifting the moderation rights to the users of the platform. This will be done with the help of a decentralized system based on blockchain which will work as an extension to already existing social media apps. 

# Technologies used
* Basic web dev tool have been used for development  
* GoLang for the block generation (due to low exposure to blockchain programming languages)
* Solidity for Smart Contracts
* Javascript for Reputation system


# Future Development
Plan to add a Repo (reputation) System so that new users or bots can't spam the voting to create unjust scenarios.
